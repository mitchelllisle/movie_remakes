      <h1>What trends are there in movie remakes?</h1>
      <h2 style="color: black">We see an average of somewhere between 2000 and 3000* movies released every year with anywhere from 5 - 10% being remakes. So how often do we see the same movie again and again and again?</h2>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>This analysis was made for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataVizRequests/comments/7irlb9/request_i_would_like_for_someone_to_visualize/">this Reddit thread.</a> The data source for this analysis was taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_film_remakes">these Wikipedia articles.</a></p>
    <h4>Years of the most remakes</h4>
    <p>The original question this analysis was endeavouring to answer was, 'How have remakes of old moves been trending over time?'. To answer this, I obtained the data from the above Wikipedia page and then looked at the movies that are classed as remakes; i.e Movies that were released after an original movie of the same name/plot. This data doesn't take into account movies that were remakes of books, it is also not clear if the data obtained is a comprehensive or exhaustive list. However, it does give some insight into the trend of movie remakes.

    As you can see from the chart below, there has been quite a ramp up in the number of movies that are remakes. We see an average of between ~5 to ~7 in the years from 1904 to around 1980. From 1980 things really start ramping up and we seek a peak of <b style="color:#F34359">28 movies</b> in 2005 being classed as remakes. Interestingly, in more recent years there has been a decline the number of remakes and a return to a more modest average of between ~6 to ~7.</p>

    <h4>Years that inspired the most remakes.</h4>
    <p>But when were the originals made? <b style="color:#4A90E2">1939</b> and <b style="color:#4A90E2">1932</b> was the year with the most movies inspiring remakes with <b style="color:#4A90E2">22 Movies</b> in total. If you look at the trend you can see that the 1930s was the most popular period of cinema we have looked to re-create.</p>
